# Titanic Survival Prediction  
This project is part of the **CODSOFT Data Science Internship Task – Titanic Survival Prediction**.  
The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on different features.

##  Project Overview  
This beginner-friendly machine-learning project uses the Titanic dataset to:  
- Perform data cleaning  
- Handle missing values  
- Encode categorical features  
- Train a Logistic Regression model  
- Predict passenger survival  
- Measure model accuracy  

---

##  Dataset Used  
The dataset contains:  
- Passenger Class  
- Sex  
- Age  
- Siblings/Spouse aboard  
- Parents/Children aboard  
- Fare  
- Embarked  
- Survival (Target variable)

File used in this project:  
**Titanic-Dataset.csv**



## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Steps Performed  
1 Importing and exploring the dataset  
2 Handling missing values  
3 Encoding categorical variables  
4 Feature selection  
5 Splitting data into train/test  
6 Training Logistic Regression model  
7 Evaluating the model  
8 Predicting survival for sample input

##  Model Accuracy  
The Logistic Regression model achieved:  

Accuracy: 0.81 (81%)

This accuracy is good for this dataset without complex tuning.



## Sample Prediction  
For passenger with:  
- Pclass: 3  
- Sex: Male  
- Age: 22  
- SibSp: 1  
- Parch: 0  
- Fare: 7.25  

### Model Output → 1 (Survived)
