#  Iris Flower Classification  
This project is part of the **CODSOFT Data Science Internship (Task 2)**.  
The objective is to classify iris flowers into three species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* — based on four flower measurements.


##  Project Overview  
The Iris dataset is one of the most famous machine learning datasets.  
It contains the following features:

- **sepal_length**
- **sepal_width**
- **petal_length**
- **petal_width**

Using these measurements, a machine learning classification model is trained to predict the flower species.

##  Dataset Used  
**File Used:** `IRIS.csv`

The dataset contains 150 rows and 5 columns:
- 4 numerical features  
- 1 target label (`species`) with 3 unique classes  

Classes after encoding:
- 0 → Setosa  
- 1 → Versicolor  
- 2 → Virginica  



##  Technologies & Libraries  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  



##  Steps Performed  
1 Loaded and explored the dataset  
2 Checked dataset statistics  
3 Encoded categorical labels  
4 Split dataset into training and testing sets  
5 Trained Logistic Regression model  
6 Evaluated accuracy  
7 Performed sample predictions  



##  Model Performance  

###  **Accuracy:** *Around 96%–99%*  
(Your execution generated a high accuracy score.)

The model classifies iris flower species with excellent performance.



##  Sample Prediction  

## Input:
[5.8, 2.7, 5.1, 1.9]

### Output:
array([2])

### Meaning:
2 → Virginica 
(The flower belongs to the Virginica species.)
